% Test for basic footnote functionality.

\starttext
This is how you write a footnote\footnote{This is a footnote}.

One can refer to footnotes\footnote[fn:1]{This is a footnote with a reference.}

See footnote~\in[fn:1] or maybe \note[fn:1] to see how to refer to footnotes.

Space before a footnote should be ignored
\footnote{This is another footnote}

Footnotes can be defined using a start-stop as well
\startfootnote
  This is a block footnote
